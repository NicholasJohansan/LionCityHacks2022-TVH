This was the hackathon project made for Lion City Hacks 2022. The theme was "Build Something Unexpected!" and we tried to aim for the *Most Unexpected Project* track, so we built a site parodying the hackathon's site.

We ended up winning **Biggest Meme of a Project**!

[Photo Coming Soon]

The possible tracks were:
- Most Unexpected Project
- Most Entertaining Project
- Best Designed Project
- Attendee's Favourite Project
- Biggest Meme of a Project
